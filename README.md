# Rust ‚ù§Ô∏è Lean - Playground

This repository is a demo for formally verifying Rust code using Lean 4. The project consists of two main components: the `src/` folder containing a Rust crate, and the `verify/` folder containing a Lean project that proves properties about the Rust code.

Utility scripts in `scripts/` help with installation of Aeneas and extraction of the lean version of the Rust code. Write some Rust code in `src/`, run Aeneas and then add the Lean proof in `verify/`.

The Rust code and verification is checked by the Github CI.

## Setup

### Compile Rust code

Assuming that Rust is installed, run:

```bash
cargo build
```

### Aeneas Installation

Run the automated setup script to install Aeneas and Charon:

```bash
bash scripts/setup-aeneas.sh
```

**What setup-aeneas.sh does:**

- Checks for required dependencies (git, OCaml/opam, make, Rust)
- Sets up OCaml 4.14.2 environment with opam and installs necessary OCaml packages
- Clones the Aeneas verification tool repository
- Clones and builds Charon (Rust-to-LLBC compiler)
- Builds Aeneas

After setup, the tools will be available at:

- Charon: `./aeneas/charon/bin/charon`
- Aeneas: `./aeneas/bin/aeneas`

### Lean Project Setup

Set up the Lean project with all dependencies:

```bash
bash scripts/setup-lean.sh
```

**What setup-lean.sh does:**

- Installs elan (Lean version manager) if not already present
- Downloads mathlib cache for faster builds with `lake exe cache get`
- Builds the Lean project in the `verify/` directory

### Lean Toolchain Sync

Keep your Lean versions synchronised:

```bash
bash scripts/update-lean-toolchain.sh
```

**What update-lean-toolchain.sh does:**

- Checks if both `verify/lean-toolchain` and `aeneas/backends/lean/lean-toolchain` exist
- Updates `verify/lean-toolchain` to match the Aeneas version if they differ

### Lean Code Extraction

Extract Lean verification code from the Rust implementation:

```bash
bash scripts/extract-lean.sh
```

**What extract-lean.sh does:**

- Runs Charon to generate LLBC (Low-Level Borrow Checker) intermediate representation
- Runs Aeneas to translate LLBC to Lean code
- Outputs generated Lean files to `verify/Verify/` directory
